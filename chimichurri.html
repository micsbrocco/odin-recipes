    <h2>What is Chimichurri? Learn about its origin</h2>
    <p>
        What is Chimichurri?
        Made with fresh parsley, garlic, oregano, and a hint of chili pepper, chimichurri can be the perfect complement to your Argentine asado. <br>
        And if you’re not sure how to prepare it, here’s a step-by-step guide to prepare the classic chimichurri recipe – the best you’ve ever tasted. <br>
        Where does the eccentric name “chimichurri” come from? Its exact origins are somewhat debated, but it’s widely believed to have originated in Argentina,<br>
        particularly among the gauchos who roamed the Argentine pampas during the 19th century. Regarding its name, some people propose that it’s derived from the <br>
        Basque word “tximitxurri,” meaning “a mixture of several things in no particular order,” which aptly describes the way this sauce is made. <br>
        Today, chimichurri’s popularity has spread far beyond the borders of Argentina and Uruguay, gaining recognition as a versatile condiment that pairs excellently<br>
        with grilled meats, including beef, pork, chicken chorizo, and Patagonian lamb.

    <h3>Ingredients: What do you need to make Chimichurri Sauce?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup fresh parsley, finely chopped/li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1/4 cup white vinegar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon red pepper flakes (adjust to taste)</li>
        <li>Salt and Pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li> 
            Prepare the ingredients: <br>
            Start by finely chopping the fresh parsley and mincing the garlic cloves, then put them into the same bowl.<br>
            Even though it may be tempting to save time, avoid using dried parsley or garlic powder, as they won’t have the same taste.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the vinegar <br>
            Then, pour the white vinegar over the parsley and garlic mixture; its acidity will help balance the flavours and give the sauce its signature tang. <br>
            If it’s your first time tasting chimichurri, perhaps you’d like to make it with milder acidity and a slightly sweeter undertone. <br>
            In that case, you can use apple cider vinegar. Others prefer to prepare this sauce with red wine vinegar, which makes it stronger. 
        </li>  
        <li>
            Drizzle in the olive oil: <br>
            Now, slowly drizzle the extra-virgin olive oil into the bowl, whisking continuously to emulsify the ingredients. You may find that some recipes opt for <br>
            a blend of oils instead of just extra-virgin olive oil. For example, sunflower oil is very popular in Argentine cuisine, with its neutral taste and high <br>
            smoke point. When it comes to chimichurri, it can add a lighter texture and ensure the sauce maintains its green color.
        </li>
        <li>
            Season with herbs and spices: <br>
            Sprinkle the dried oregano and red pepper flakes (ají molido) over the mixture, then season with salt and pepper to taste while using a spoon or whisk to mix all the ingredients together.
        </li>
        <li>
            Taste and adjust> <br>
            It’s time to taste your chimichurri and fine-tune it to your taste. So, grab a spoon, put a bit of the sauce on a piece of bread and taste it! <br>
            Perhaps you find that the chimichurri could benefit from a touch more acidity, so you can add more vinegar. Or maybe you realize you put too much ají molido, which you can solve by adding more oil.
        </li>
        <li>
            Let it rest: <br>
            Time for the grand finale: cover the sauce and let it sit at room temperature for at least 30 minutes (don’t be tempted into using it right away!). Freshly prepared chimichurri <br>
            can sometimes have sharp, intense flavors, particularly from the raw garlic and vinegar, that won’t be tasty. Instead, allowing your chimichurri sauce to rest will significantly <br>
            enhance its texture while balancing its taste. Some experts even suggest preparing chimichurri a few days in advance or even weeks before you plan to use it to maximize its development.</li>
