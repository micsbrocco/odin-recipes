    <h3>Ingredients: What do you need to make a Choripan?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Chorizo (It can be either Chorizo Criollo or Chorizo Parrillero)</li>
        <li>Bread rolls</li>
        <li>Chimichurri</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps: How to make a Choripan</h3>
    <ol>
        <li> 
            Preheat the Grill: <br>
            Once you’ve lit up your fire, ensure your grill is preheated to the right temperature. 
            Aim for a medium-high heat, around 375-400°F (190-200°C), to properly cook chorizos without them bursting open!
        </li>
        <li>
            Prepare the Chorizos: <br> 
            To further prevent your chorizos from bursting while grilling, lightly score them with a knife 
            before placing them on the grill. In this way, steam will be able to escape the chorizo and ensure they cook evenly while staying intact.
        </li>  
        <li>
            Grill the Chorizos: <br>
            Once your grill is hot and your chorizos are prepped, it’s time to get grilling! Place the chorizos directly on the grill grates (but away from the embers!) and cook them for about 15-25 minutes, 
            turning them occasionally with tongs. Don’t just leave them there: keep an eye on your chorizos to prevent burning and aim for that irresistible charred exterior and juicy interior.
        </li>
        <li>
            Toast the Bread: <br>
            While your chorizos are grilling, slice your bread rolls in half and toast them on the grill, too. This adds a delightful crunch!
        </li>
        <li>
            Assemble and Serve: <br>
            Assembling your choripan is super easy: simply nestle your chorizos inside the toasted bread rolls, and remember to add your favorite condiments, such as salsa criolla or chimichurri.
