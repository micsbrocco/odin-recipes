    <h4>Ever heard of Salsa Golf? This is an Argentine sauce that strikes the perfect balance between creamy and savory.<br>
        While it’s not as well known as chimichurri, it’s still very popular in Argentina, especially to accompany Argentine asado.
    </h4>

    <h2>The Origins of Salsa Golf</h2>
    <p>The beginnings of Salsa Golf are wrapped in food stories, with different ideas about where it came from.<br>
        Most stories claim it was invented by Argentine golfers who wanted a tasty sauce for their meals while playing golf.<br>
        They supposedly mixed two common ingredients, mayonnaise and ketchup, to make a sauce that went well with many foods, especially burgers. 
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients: What do you need to make Salsa Golf?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup mayonnaise</li>
        <li>1/4 cup ketchup</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Dijon mustard</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li> 
            Mix Mayonnaise and Ketchup: <br>
            Start by combining the mayonnaise and ketchup in a mixing bowl. Use a whisk or spatula to thoroughly mix both ingredients until the mixture is smooth and uniform in color.<br>
            Taste the mixture as you go and adjust the ratio of mayonnaise to ketchup according to your preference for creaminess or tanginess. For a creamier sauce, add more mayonnaise, 
            and for a tangier sauce, add more ketchup.<br>
            And if you prefer sweeter flavors, consider using sweetened ketchup or adding a touch of honey or sugar to make your Salsa Golf even tastier!
        </li>
        <li>
            Add lemon juice: <br>
            Squeeze in the fresh lemon juice to give the sauce a bright and citrusy flavor. Avoid using bottled lemon juice, as it may lack freshness. A piece of advice: start with a small <br>
            amount of lemon juice and gradually increase to taste, as it can easily overpower the other ingredients.
        </li>  
        <li>
            Incorporate the other sauces: <br>
            Pour in the Worcestershire sauce and the Dijon Mustard, which helps emulsify the ingredients and create a smooth and creamy texture. <br>
            Opt for quality Worcestershire sauce and Dijon mustard for the best taste. Cheaper varieties may lack depth and complexity, ruining your Salsa Golf.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add minced garlic: <br>
            Finely mince a clove of garlic and add it to the sauce. Alternatively, you can use a garlic press for convenience. And if you’re not a fan of the sharpness of raw garlic, <br>
            you can briefly sauté it in a small amount of olive oil before adding it to the Salsa Golf. 
            Refrigerate the sauce for at least 30 minutes, or preferably longer, to allow your Salsa Golf to meld together.
        </li>
        <li>
            Assemble and Serve: <br>
            Assembling your choripan is super easy: simply nestle your chorizos inside the toasted bread rolls, and remember to add your favorite condiments, such as salsa criolla or chimichurri.
        </li>
    </ol>
